<ul>
<li>This is the front-end I made during the course "Full Stack Open 2022" organized by the Open University of Helsinki.</li>
<li>Made with Node.js, Express and MongoDB</li> 
<li>The assignment was based on the lecture's instructions, as well as my own research and commitment</li> 
<li>With this exercise, I learned to create and combine both front-end and back-end parts of a web application</li>
